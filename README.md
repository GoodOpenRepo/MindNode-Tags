# MindNode-Tags
MindNode Tags is an extension for MindNode that adds tags and filtering. The app runs as a separate applicaiton and works by editing the xml file inside MindNode files.

I made this app as I love MindNode but wish that it had tags. This is my first Mac applicaiton. Let me know if you find it helpful.

## Known Problem 
* In some cases changes to a note will be lost. If you edit a note then strait to mindnode-tags and filter on one of the tags your changes will be lost. To stop this either click elsewhere on the map or save the document before filtering
* The program only works when the file type is "Package" and not "Single File"
