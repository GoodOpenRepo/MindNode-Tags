# MindNode-Tags
MindNode Tags is an extension for MindNode that adds tags and filtering. The app runs as a separate applicaiton and works by editing the xml file inside MindNode files.

I made this app as I love MindNode but wish that it had tags. This is my first Mac applicaiton. Let me know if you find it helpful.
